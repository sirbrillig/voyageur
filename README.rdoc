== Voyageur

A website for storing locations (addresses) and calculating the driving distance
between them in varying order. Uses Google Maps API for calculations.

=== TODO

* Ability to set a default starting location (eg: Home)
* Background adding locations to trips so no page refresh is required.
* Multiple trips with an easy way to organize and clear them all.
